Task 2 â€” Understanding the Mint Classics Database

In this task, I'll be diving into the Mint Classics database. I'll use the provided Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) as a guide to understand how the tables are connected. My main focus will be exploring the contents of each table to get a clear picture of how data is organized and connected across different parts of the database. This exploration will help me grasp how Mint Classics stores and manages its business information.
