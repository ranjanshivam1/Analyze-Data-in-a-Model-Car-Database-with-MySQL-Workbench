**Task 1 â€” Importing the Classic Car Model Database**

For this task, I'll begin by initiating the import of the Mint Classics relational database using MySQL Workbench. To kickstart this process, I'll download the SQL file containing the script required for both creating and populating the database. Once obtained, I'll proceed by executing this script within MySQL Workbench, importing it into the platform. To validate the successful integration, I'll meticulously verify the presence and functionality of the imported database within the MySQL Workbench environment.

**Task Steps:**

1. **Download Database:** Access the SQL file essential for database creation and population from the [Download Database Link].

2. **Import Database Script:** Within MySQL Workbench, execute the import process by incorporating the SQL script downloaded earlier.

3. **Verification:** Thoroughly verify the presence and functionality of the Mint Classics relational database to ensure a successful import within the MySQL Workbench interface.
