## Task 1 â€” Importing the Classic Car Model Database

For this task, I'll begin by initiating the import of the Mint Classics relational database using MySQL Workbench. 
To kickstart this process, I'll download the SQL file containing the script required for both creating and populating the database.

To validate the successful integration, I'll meticulously verify the presence and functionality of the imported database within the MySQL Workbench environment.

Task Steps:

1. Download Database: Access the SQL file essential for database creation and population from the
